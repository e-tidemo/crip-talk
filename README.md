# Introduction

Crip Talk is a forum website created by and for people with disabilities where we can have a space for everything in life with the added spice of everyone having a disabled perspective. There is, of course, no way to monitor whether or not each user actually has a disability but that is less important as the main point is to create a digital space designated to the crip community. The most important thing is that everyone follows the forum community guidelines which is easier to monitor.

# User Experience (UX)
To plan and produce this project, I used an agile methodology. I used the project tool in GitHub to keep track of the different processes to produce functions that the website needed to have. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/users/e-tidemo/projects/4).

I missed the Epics (GitHub Milestones) as I was working on the project. These can add an overall theme to a group of user stories and would have been useful in the process of creating this project. I will look into this more and use Epics in future projects. 

The picture below is the Kanban board of my project.

The user stories were also mapped up in the document below. Because of some limitations in time, I needed to create some system of priority and decided to categorise all user stories as "must have", "should have" or "could have". As is evident in the image below, I did not manage to find time to finish two of the user stories which I have categorised as "could have". These have, instead, been brought up in the [Future Features](##future-features) section below.

# Features


## Future Features
Due to limitations in time, I have not managed to add all features and functions that I would have liked. The following are some features that should or could improve this app in the future:

- In the future, the forum site should have a function to check if a user is trying to sign up with an email adress that is already registered on the forum.

# Design
The design of this website is quite simple as it is meant to be specifically for people who are differently abled and therefore it was designed to be as accessible as possible. I have kept colours quite simple and avoided using photos and instead used illustrations as this is less work for the eyes.

## Colour scheme:

## Fonts
Google Fonts were used to import two different fonts which were chosen with accessibility in mind. I read the following article from Google: [Introducing Accessibility in Typography](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/readability_and_accessibility/introducing_accessibility_in_typography) by Susanna Zaraysky. Based on this article, the following fonts were chosen as they have letters that are easily distinguishable from each other:

- "Roboto" - which was used for paragraphs and some buttons
- "Bebas Neue" - which was used for headlines and some buttons

## Wireframes

The final website is slightly different from the wireframes presented here but these were what guided the layout of the web pages.

## Accessibility
I have done the following to make sure the website is as accessible as possible:
- Used semantic HTML
- Used contrasting colours throughout the website
- Provided information for screen readers about buttons and links to other websites
