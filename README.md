# Introduction

Crip Talk is a forum website created by and for people with disabilities where we can have a space for everything in life with the added spice of everyone having a disabled perspective. There is, of course, no way to monitor whether or not each user actually has a disability but that is less important as the main point is to create a digital space designated to the crip community. The most important thing is that everyone follows the forum community guidelines.
